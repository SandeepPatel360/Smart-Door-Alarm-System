# Components Needed
  <ul>
    <li>Arduino uno</li>
    <li>Magnetic Contact Switch - Door Sensor</li>
    <li>Buzzer</li>
    <li>Breadboard and some cable</li>
  </ul>

# Magnetic Door Sensor (Reed Switch):
<ul>
  <li>Since the switch is non polar, you can plug in the wires any way.</li>
  <li>Connect one wire of the switch to a jumper wire and plug the jumper wire pin to pin GND on the POWER side of the Arduino</li>
  <li>Connect the other switch wire to another jumper wire, and plug that jumper wire into pin 4 of the Arduino.</li>
</ul>
